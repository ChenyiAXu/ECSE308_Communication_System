# ECSE308_Labs

## [Lab 0: Introduction to Simulink and Wireshark](https://github.com/ChenyiAXu/ECSE308_Communication_System/tree/main/Lab%200)
- **Objective:** Get familiar with Simulink and Wireshark tools.
- **Description:**
  - Simulink: Learn the basics of creating models using Simulink.
  - Wireshark: Explore network traffic capturing and analysis using Wireshark.

## [Lab 1: Signals and Noise](https://github.com/ChenyiAXu/ECSE308_Communication_System/tree/main/Lab%201)
### Part 1: Presentation of Signals and Noise
- **Objective:** Understand basic signal and noise concepts using Simulink.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Periodic/Non-periodic Signals**: Explore signals with repeating patterns (periodic) and those without (non-periodic).
  - **Deterministic/Random Signals**: Understand the difference between signals that are predictable (deterministic) and those that are not (random).
  - **Gaussian/Thermal Noise**: Examine common noise types in signals.

### Part 2: Power, Bandwidth & SNR
- **Objective:** Analyze the power and bandwidth of both deterministic and random signals.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Signal Power**: Measure and compare power levels of different signals.
  - **Bandwidth**: Understand the bandwidth requirements for transmitting signals.
  - **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Learn how to calculate and interpret SNR values to assess signal quality.
  - **Filtering**: Implement filters to remove unwanted noise and improve signal clarity.
